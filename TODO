- parsing and reading a mulTTY connection; event-style with callbacks
+ multiplexer switching between programs in the same program set
- multiplexer switching to parent and child program sets
- multiplexer switching to some program, crossing over program sets
+ dependency-free integration of multiplexer switching during mtyflush()
- nested multiplexer operation -- passing through child multiplexers
- nested demultiplexer -- all levels in one demultiplexer
- nested demultiplexer -- with cut-off for pass-through
- local PIPE_BUF --> static/checked ATOMIC_SEND_MAX and ATOMIC_RECV_MIN
- independent mulTTY connections?  [like in SCTP streams]
